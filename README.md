Morse Code Overview
Morse code is a method of encoding text using sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and symbols. It was widely used in telegraph communication and remains relevant today in aviation, military, and emergency signaling.

Historical Context
Morse code was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s as a way to transmit messages over long distances using electrical telegraphs. It played a crucial role in early communication systems before the invention of the telephone. Over time, it became widely adopted in radio transmissions, maritime distress signals (SOS), and even space communications.

How Morse Code Works
Each letter, number, and symbol is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

Dots (.) are short signals.

Dashes (-) are longer signals.

A space separates words for clarity.

English Alphabet Representation
Here is the Morse code for the English alphabet:

A -> .-      B -> -...   C -> -.-.   D -> -..    E -> .
F -> ..-.    G -> --.    H -> ....   I -> ..     J -> .---
K -> -.-     L -> .-..   M -> --     N -> -.     O -> ---
P -> .--.    Q -> --.-   R -> .-.    S -> ...    T -> -
U -> ..-     V -> ...-   W -> .--    X -> -..-   Y -> -.--   Z -> --..
Examples of Morse Code Translations
HELLO → .... . .-.. .-.. ---

WORLD → .-- --- .-. .-.. -..

SOS (Distress Signal) → ... --- ...
